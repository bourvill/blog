# UIColor : Quick tips and color your Life!

Before start, we need to create an extension, it’s simple.
Create a new file with this:

```
extension UIColor {
}
```

## UIColor with Int for RGB color

Now we can create an initializer for UIColor and to be able to handle Int value

```swift
extension UIColor {
     convenience init(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int) {
        assert(red >= 0 && red <= 255, "Invalid red")
        assert(green >= 0 && green <= 255, "Invalid green")
        assert(blue >= 0 && blue <= 255, "Invalid blue")
        self.init(red: CGFloat(red) / 255.0, green: CGFloat(green) / 255.0, blue: CGFloat(blue) / 255.0, alpha: 1.0)
    }
}
```

In this part of code, we have created a “_convenience_” initializer

_Convenience initializers are also aptly named, and they are initializers used to make initialization a bit easier._
_Designated initializers tend to set all of the properties up and let the user send in values for each. A convenience initializer often has some of those hard coded, and thus can take less parameters._
_The developer usually write’s a convenience initializer to set some defaults that are appropriate to a special use case._

And we use a “_assert_” keyword
_Assert is first shot I came along for asserts._
_As expected, assert() is evaluated only in debug mode (this is the general rule for asserts in programming languages)._

Now you can use in your code like this:

```swift
let color = UIColor(red: 100, green: 50, blue: 50)
```

## UIColor from hex

Now add an initializer for UIColor and to be able to handle Hexa value

```swift
extension UIColor {
    convenience init(hex:Int) {
        self.init(red:(hex >> 16) & 0xff, green:(hex >> 8) & 0xff, blue:hex & 0xff)
    }
}
```

and use like this:

```swift
let red = UIColor(hex: 0xFF0000)
```

Enjoy! And now color your life !
