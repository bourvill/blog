# Convert int to her string literal representation

## NumberFormatter

Swift come with many formatter, we can found DateFormatter, LengthFormatter, EnergyFormatter.

Today I will introduce NumberFormatter, A formatter that converts between numeric values and their textual representations.

## Code

```
import Foundation

let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.string(from: 30)
```

Simple right? I'm kidding, it's obviously not enough.

But here is the basic structure of the formatter

## Tuning

Formatter come with many parameter.

For exemple if you want their textual representations of the number use the numberStyle property

```
let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = .spellOut
formatter.string(from: 30)

// Output : Trentre
```

But you can get the currency value of this number

```
let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = .currency
formatter.string(from: 30)
// Output : 30,00€
```

## Fine Tuning

In the previous examples we got results in French. My native language.

But we can ask the format to use another locale

```
import Foundation

let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "us_US")
formatter.numberStyle = .currency
formatter.string(from: 30)

// Output : $ 30.00
```

## Bonus

Many people have trouble reading numbers: dyscalculia
You can help with people with this simple trick

```
import Foundation

let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = .currency
formatter.groupingSize = 3
formatter.string(from: 30000)

// Output: 30 000,00€
```

Simple!

## And now ?

As you have seen this formatter brings a lot of logic in relation to the user's locale, its monetary representation, but also its grammatical form.

Don't code any more house stuff, use this formatter :)

### Before leaving?

In a next article I will talk about another component provided by default about progress :)
