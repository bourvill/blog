# Write Color Picker in 5 minutes with swiftUI

Playgrounds app is the most powerful tool to write thing and test.
Playgrounds is available on MacOs and iPadOs, and the code sample is written on this tool.

## Preparing Playgrounds for SwiftUI

```swift
// Import framework
import SwiftUI
import Combine
import PlaygroundSupport

// Create View
struct SandboxView: View {

    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome")
    }
}

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(SandboxView())

```

Press play, Playgrounds now show a live view view the "Welcome text"

## The ColorPicker with SwiftUI

### First Part : ObservableObject

```swift
final class ColorPicker: ObservableObject {
    @Published var red: Double = 0
    @Published var green: Double = 0
    @Published var blue: Double = 0
    @Published var color = Color.white

    var cancellable: AnyCancellable?

    init() {
    	// Combine each change on publisher red, green, blue, map to Color, and assign to published color
        cancellable = Publishers.CombineLatest3($red, $green, $blue)
	        .map { (arg0) in let (r, g, b) = arg0;
	            return Color(red: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255)
	        }
        	.assign(to: \.color, on: self)
    }
}
```

### Update Sandbox view and play

Now update the SandboxView

```swift
struct SandboxView: View {
    @ObservedObject var colorPicker = ColorPicker()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Slider(value: $colorPicker.red, in: 0...255, step: 1)
            Text("Red \(colorPicker.red, specifier: "%.0f")")
            Slider(value: $colorPicker.green, in: 0...255, step: 1)
            Text("Green \(colorPicker.green, specifier: "%.0f")")
            Slider(value: $colorPicker.blue, in: 0...255, step: 1)
            Text("Blue \(colorPicker.blue, specifier: "%.0f")")
            Rectangle().foregroundColor(colorPicker.color)
        }
    }
}
```

Now you can play with a ColorPicker, Simple right ?
